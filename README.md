### Simple Shell Project<br>

The following are the commands for the shell: <br>

**cd  <directory>**  This command (which stands for "change directory") is used to change the current working directory in the shell. This means that any commands or scripts that are executed will act on files and directories within the newly specified directory. <br>
**clr:**  command is used to clear the terminal screen of any previously executed commands, output or text, giving a clean slate to work on. <br>
**dir <directory>** Lists the contents of a directory. <br>
**environ** List all the environment strings. <br>
**echo <comment>** This command is used to display a message or a value on the terminal. <br>
**help** Displays all valid functionality of the shell. <br>
**pause:** Pauses operation of the shell until the "ENTER" key is hit <br>
**quit:** Quits the shell <br>

**Environment Concepts**<br><br>
When the shell executes a program, it creates an environment for the new process that includes various pieces of information such as environment variables, file descriptors, and other settings. The statement specifies that the environment created for these child processes should contain an entry that sets the 'parent' environment variable to the pathname of the 'myshell' executable. This environment variable can then be used by the child process to access information about the parent shell.<br>


**I/O Redirection**<br><br>
The shell should support the command line syntax of programname arg1 arg2 < inputfile > outputfile, which runs the programname command with the specified arguments (arg1 and arg2), and replaces the stdin and stdout streams with the contents of inputfile and outputfile, respectively. Furthermore, the shell supports output redirection for certain built-in commands, namely dir, environ, echo, and help. This means that these commands can be run with their output redirected to a file using the same > and >> redirection operators as described in the previous answer.<br>

**Background Execution**<br><br>
Background execution allows you to start a program and then continue using the shell without waiting for the program to finish.
To launch a program in the background, you can add an ampersand character (&) to the end of the command line. For example, the command 'pause &' would pause one procces in the background, allowing you to continue using the shell prompt without have to press 'ENTER' to exit.<br>
